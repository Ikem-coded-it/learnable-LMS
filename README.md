## How it works

This is modelled after Teachable LMS. In Teachable, you can sign up as a "creator" (you produce learning content) or you sign up as a student, this automatically happens when you are enrolled into a school by a creator.

A school is created by a Creator. It is a platform that hosts all of the creators learning products which could include:

- courses
- coaching
- digital download such as videos, pdf, etc
- community: A creatoe can put together a community of students (new feature according to Teachable)

## Instructions to run

- clone the repo
- install dependencies using `npm i` or `pnpm install`
- run `node index.js` in your terminal.
